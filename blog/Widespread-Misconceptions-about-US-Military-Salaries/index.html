                            <p class="blog-date">November 29th, 2014</p>
							
							<p><strong>I've noticed that few people actually know how much money military members earn.</strong> Even among military members, there is a general lack of knowledge on the subject and a surprising amount of misinformation spread among the troops. While a quick Google search will indeed yield results, the numbers shown on most websites do not tell the whole story. Aside from being formatted in tables that are <a href="references/2014-Web-Pay-Table.pdf">unintelligible to the average person</a>, Basic Pay figures are not comprehensive. There are sizable monetary allowances not mentioned anywhere on many of the websites you'll find and significant tax breaks that need to be taken into account before arriving at the final equivalent civilian salary. Many people would be surprised by how high military salaries actually are.</p>
							
							<p>I'll show you some examples of military salaries below, describe how I arrive at those numbers, and finally explain why I think overcoming these misconceptions could be a significant aid in attracting and retaining quality military members.</p>
							
							<h3 class="center">The Basics</h3>
							
							<p>The first thing I need to point out is that total military pay is composed of money from a few different sources. Although all of it is delivered by one paycheck into service members' bank accounts, portions of that money are categorized before distribution for tax and appropriations reasons. Every military member is given money (or sometimes accommodations of equal value) from the following three sources:</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Basic Pay
							<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)
							<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS)
							</p>
							
							<p>Basic Pay is what you see on most of those cryptic tables you find when you Google &quot;military salary&quot;. Basic Pay is subject to taxes and varies based on rank and years of service. BAH and BAS are the two standard tax-free allowances for housing and food. BAH increases by rank, but BAS is a flat amount for officers and a different flat amount for enlisted. Many military members are given additional allowances and bonuses beyond BAH and BAS (for example, members in aviation-related jobs receive additional incentive pay), but BAH and BAS are the standard two allowances received by everyone, so I'll only include those two allowances and Basic Pay in my calculations. Basic Pay, BAH, and BAS are typically listed as monthly amounts.</p>
							
							<h3 class="center">Number Crunching</h3>
							
							<p>The most accurate way I see to calculate equivalent salary is to take total after-tax income and calculate the gross income required in a regular job to take home the same amount. When salaries are discussed anywhere&#8212;among friends and colleagues, at job interviews, when applying for a loan&#8212;pre-tax, gross income is always the value discussed. I've never heard anyone talk about how much they make after taxes are taken out. Additionally, the number I arrive at is the actual salary you'd have to earn in a regular job to have the same take-home pay. In other words, I think this is the most valid way to express a military member's equivalent salary.</p>
							
							<p><strong>All military members are paid well, enlisted included.</strong> I’d argue that officers may even be overpaid. Before you dismiss those claims, realize that the average 18-year-old enlisting right out of high school makes the equivalent of over $40,000 per year with zero experience. I've had actual enlisted members reject that claim, so I understand if you're incredulous. Here are my calculations for those of you in disbelief:</p>
							
							<figure class="img-mid">
							<img class="border" src="references/E-3-calc.jpg" alt="E-3 Equivalent Salary" />
							<br />
							<figcaption>E-3 Equivalent Salary</figcaption><br />
							</figure>
							<hr />
							
							<p>How many other jobs pay 18-year-olds with no experience over $40k/year with exceptional benefits, paid training, and job security? Not many. It isn't only fresh recruits who are paid well, either. Here are additional examples of salaries for enlisted and officers at various points in their careers:</p>
							
							<figure class="img-mid">
							<img class="border" src="references/E-5-calc.jpg" alt="E-5 Equivalent Salary" />
							<br />
							<figcaption>Enlisted E-5 with 8 years of service. This is typically someone around 26 years old who enlisted immediately after high school.</figcaption><br />
							</figure>
							<hr />
							
							<figure class="img-mid">
							<img class="border" src="references/O-2-calc.jpg" alt="O-2 Equivalent Salary" />
							<br />
							<figcaption>Officer O-2 with 3 years of service. This is typically someone around 25 years old who commissioned immediately after completing his undergraduate degree.</figcaption><br />
							</figure>
							<hr />
							
							<figure class="img-mid">
							<img class="border" src="references/O-4-calc.jpg" alt="O-4 Equivalent Salary" />
							<br />
							<figcaption>Officer O-4 with 12 years of service. This is typically someone around 34 years old who commissioned immediately after completing his undergraduate degree. By now he has most likely earned a graduate degree of some kind.</figcaption><br />
							</figure>
							<hr />
							
							<p>As you can see, salaries in the military are extremely competitive throughout the ranks. From the teenager making $42k/year to the 34-year-old making almost $120k, it is difficult to argue that the military is not paid well, especially when you consider the fact that these figures do not include the extremely generous military benefits, including, among other benefits, 100% free health care, paid education, and an unbeatable pension requiring no monetary contributions.</p>
							
							<h3 class="center">The Pension</h3>
							
							<p><strong>Let's take a closer look at that ridiculous pension.</strong> You're eligible to retire from the military with a pension at or beyond 20 years of service. You collect your retirement pay immediately after retirement until the day you die at 50% of the average of your last three years of Basic Pay, and you receive an additional 2.5 percentage points for each year beyond 20. For example, a member retiring at 25 years of service would receive 62.5% of his Basic Pay every month until his death.</p>
							
							<p>If the enormity of that pension hasn't already hit you, let me explain how much that pension is worth through an example. For an officer retiring at 20 years as an O-5 (fairly typical), his monthly retirement income will be $4,211.10, increasing annually for inflation. This officer is typically around 42 years old and will draw this retirement income until his death, so his retirement is essentially a Single Life Annuity. For simplicity, we'll pretend his monthly income isn't adjusted for inflation each year (although that fact is worth a lot of money). Shop around and you'll see that, currently, a Single Life Annuity paying $4,211.10 monthly for someone 42 years old will cost you around $1.2 million. Again, that isn't even including the inflation adjustments, which would add a significant amount to that figure.</p>
							
							<p><strong>How much would it cost to save up for that annuity over a 20-year career?</strong> If you look at an <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/article/investing-calculator/lifeandmoney_investing/">investment calculator</a>, you can see how much you'd need to invest in the stock market over 20 years to end your career with $1.2 million. Assuming an annual rate of return of 10% in a large-cap stock market index fund and average annual inflation of 3%, we will have an adjusted average annual return of 7% (the reasoning behind all that could comprise an entire blog post of its own). If you run the numbers at 7% to save for $1.2 million, you'll find that you need to save $2,300 every month during your 20-year career to save enough to purchase an annuity equal to the one provided by the military.<strong>In other words, that O-5's retirement is worth an additional $27,600/year throughout his career.</strong> How that number should be added to his equivalent salary&#8212;or whether it should be at all&#8212;could be debated, so I won't add it on. You can see, however, that military retirement is indisputably worth a lot of money.</p>
							
							<h3 class="center">Why does all this matter?</h3>
							
							<p>How many random Americans know how good the money is in the military? I’ve actually had a family member ask me whether the military even paid me a salary, or if they just provided me with housing and food. There is clearly a disconnect and lack of communication to the masses. In top high schools and colleges around the country, look at how many people choose to enlist or commission. The numbers are almost zero, even during times like this when the military is practically worshipped by the American public.</p>
							
							<p>A key element in retaining good people in the military is attracting good people to begin with, and simply making more people aware of military salaries would be a great start. I'm not implying the military doesn't get some good people, but they could certainly do a better job of appealing to high achievers. I've never seen a single military recruiting advertisement targeted toward high achievers. They all tend to appeal to emotion, self-sacrifice, &quot;the greater good&quot;, etc., and while many of those values are worthy of pursuit, those methods of recruiting don't often appeal to people who have lots of options. In fact, aside of maybe the service academies, many people who turn to the military do so because of a lack of options or financial resources. In some families and areas of the country, you’re even seen as a failure for choosing to join the military&#8212;as though you've ran out of options&#8212;especially if you choose to do so instead of immediately attending college.</p>
							
							<p>Adequate communication of military salaries and benefits to the general American public is something that is severely lacking. When you google &quot;military salary,&quot; what comes up are those Basic Pay tables I discussed, which look atrociously low. Little does everyone know that, as I've shown here, the equivalent salaries are actually extremely competitive. Simple knowledge of that fact could attract many talented people who would be otherwise uninterested in military service. <strong>Investment Banking, known for grueling hours and mind-numbing work, still successfully recruits top talent because everyone knows the job pays well.</strong></p>
							
							<p>The military spends literally billions of dollars on recruiting each year. It blows my mind that almost none of it centers around the excellent salaries, especially when that strategy is an great way to attract talented people. Simple ignorance about the whole system undoubtedly prevents many people from joining the military. If you throw around some big numbers, people will start to investigate.</p>

							<p><a href="http://peek.usertesting.com/">Peek</a> is a service by UserTesting that lets you see and hear a 5-minute video of a real person using your website. I wanted to try out the service and was pleasantly surprised with how insightful and useful the feedback that I received.</p>
<p>I also know Phil Sharp, the Senior Marketing Manager at UserTesting and I decided to ask him a couple of questions to find out more about Peek. Here&#8217;s what he had to say.</p>
<div class="img-mid"><img src="http://jadlimcaco.com/wp-content/uploads/peek.png" alt="Peek by User Testing" /></div>
<hr />
<h3>Why is user testing important?</h3>
<p>Great question! I think the main reason is that most of us as marketers, designers, and product managers are too close to our products. After spending months building and refining your site or app, you know it like the back of your hand. No matter how hard you try, you can&#8217;t unknow it.</p>
<p>Beyond this, you and everyone you know is biased. No matter how helpful your coworkers, family members, or friends want to be, it&#8217;s very hard to call your baby ugly. You need fresh, unbiased eyes to give you the feedback you need.</p>
<p>If you do usability testing right, you can really understand the mindset of the user. It&#8217;s one thing to make sure there are no errors being logged, or that people are getting through your funnel. <strong>It&#8217;s another thing to fully understand how people use and perceive your product</strong>. With usability testing, and specifically our solution at <a title="User Testing for your Website" href="http://usertesting.com">UserTesting.co</a>m, you can see and hear feedback from real people in your target market as they use your site or app. This is a powerful weapon that every developer, designer, and product owner should have access to and use frequently.</p>

<hr />
<h3>How can Peek(User Testing) help us for user testing?</h3>
<p>Peek is a quick way to get a gut check into how users perceive and use your site. It&#8217;s a great free (and incredibly simple) introduction to usability testing. We designed it so that if you have a client or colleague new to usability testing you can introduce them to the idea. For some projects, a simple Peek test might be enough to find the biggest usability issues. For many projects it&#8217;s simply a starting point that can give you direction on what might need to be tested more in depth.</p>
<hr />
<p>I ran Peek on my website twice and you can watch the videos for yourself. It was a little weird watching other people use my website and talk about their experience, but I found it to be really helpful. There are definitely some changes that I have already made from watching these videos, and there are some more changes that I plan to make in the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">“Many people believe in user testing, but in real design projects, not much testing takes place. Why the discrepancy between belief and action? Mainly, it is the company’s inability to fire off a quick, small test when faced with a design decision. Few organizations can run such tests within the deadlines required by fast-moving development projects.”</p>
